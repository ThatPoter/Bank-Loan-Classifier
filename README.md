# Predict Loan Status with a Classification Model

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
  This project was created with two objectives.
  One is to understand what are the characteristics that differentiate a person who pays his loan on time from one who does not.
  The other is with those characteristics identified being able to train a model so that in the future the bank can use it to predict who are the good and bad debtors.

### Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Classification Predictive Modeling (Binary)
* Model Evaluation

### Technologies
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn

## Project Description
  These data correspond to a week in September, in which 400 loan requests were accepted at an American Bank. Of these 400, 100 were collected, and the other 300 were paid on time.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
