# Predict Loan Status with a Classification Model

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
  This project was created with two objectives.
  One is that the bank needs to understand what are the characteristics that differentiate a person who pays his loan on time from one who does not.
  The other is, with those characteristics identified, being able to train a model so that in the future the bank can use it to predict who are the good and bad debtors.

## Project Description
  These data correspond to a week in September, in which 400 loan requests were accepted at an American Bank. Of these 400, 100 were collected, and the other 300 were paid on time.

## Needs of this project

- python coding
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling/machine learning (in work)
- write-up/reporting (in work)
